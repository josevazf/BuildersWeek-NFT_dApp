# Website

The website was developed with React and deployed with [Netflify](https://www.netlify.com/) via a GitHub repository that keeps the website in sync with any update commited. 
###
To get the project running, navigate to the root directory of the `/website` folder, and the the following command to install the dependencies of the project listed in `package.json`:

```Shell
npm install
```
Once those have finished installing, run the following to start:

```Shell
npm start
```
Doing so should open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser, where you'll see the frontend for our project.
