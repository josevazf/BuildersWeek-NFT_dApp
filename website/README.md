# Builders Week 2023 NFT dApp - Website

This project was developed during the Builders Week event held in Lisbon from 5-9 June.
###
The goal was to create a simple dApp that allows a user to mint a NFT related to the event. 
###
This is divided into two parts, the [Smart Contract](https://github.com/josevazf/BuildersWeek-Minter_Contract) to interact with the Polygon blockchain and the [Website](https://github.com/josevazf/BuildersWeek-Minter_Website) to allow the interaction between the user and the Smart Contract.
###
The Website was deployed on Netlify and it simply allows you to connect a Metamask wallet (to Polygon network), input your name/nickname that will be engraved in the NFT as metadata and mint the NFT to your address.
This was intended to be minted by the participants of Builders Week so the minting is capped to 123 NFTs and available for 30 days after deployment of the contract.
