# Website

The website was developed with React and deployed with [Netflify](https://www.netlify.com/) via a GitHub repository that keeps the website in sync with any update commited. 
###
It also uses [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) to store and pin the NFT metadata on IPFS, Alchemy RPC and [alchemy-web3](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/alchemy-web3) to provide enhanced API methods to interact with Ethereum.
#
To get the project running, navigate to the root directory of the `/website` folder, and the the following command to install the dependencies of the project listed in `package.json`:
```Shell
npm install
```
Once those have finished installing, run the following to start:
```Shell
npm start
```
Doing so should open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser, where you'll see the frontend for the project.
